# 👋 Hi, I'm Jakob Neubig

I'm a data science learner from Hamburg, currently completing the **Data Scientist Professional Track on DataCamp**. I'm B.A. Social Science with a focus on statistics.
I’m especially drawn to the intersection between **data, human behavior, and decision-making** — how numbers tell stories, and how structure can bring clarity to complexity.
I'm currently looking for an internship.
