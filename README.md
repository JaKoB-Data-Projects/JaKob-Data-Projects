# 👋 Hi, I'm Jakob Neubig  

I'm a data science learner from Hamburg, currently completing the **Data Scientist Professional Track on DataCamp**.  
I hold an B.A. in **Social Science** with a focus on statistics.  

I'm fascinated by how **numbers tell stories** — connecting **data, people, and the world we live in**.  
My work combines analytical clarity with curiosity about what data can reveal about human behavior, social systems, and change.

### 🔍 Selected Projects  

**🎬 Netflix Movies Analysis**  
Exploring trends in Netflix’s global catalog — genres, release years.  
*Tools:* Python, pandas, matplotlib  

**🏫 NYC Schools Performance**  
Analyzing how socioeconomic factors influence student achievement across New York City schools.  
*Tools:* Python, NumPy, scikit-learn  

**🏅 Nobel Prize Data Exploration**  
Investigating gender and geographic patterns among Nobel Prize laureates over time.  
*Tools:* pandas, plotly, storytelling  

Each project helped me refine my workflow — from **data cleaning to visualization and insight communication**.
